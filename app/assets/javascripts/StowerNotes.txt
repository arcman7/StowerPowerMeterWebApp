Take a measurement of the signal strength - (fake it for now)

Take into account the phone model to get mAH (assume its a new phone, and assume iphone6)

Now we can make calculations as to how long of each service type the phone can support
 - user inputs those times
 ex:

 Talk: 50 min
 Camerera: 30min
 GPS: 2 hrs
 music: 3 hrs

 => Okay you need 80% phone charge

 => if greater than 100%, popup suggesting you check out the market place
